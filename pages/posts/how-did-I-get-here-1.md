# Record Everything

Reflection is good. Reflection is how you can gain both self-confidence and self-awareness. 

I try to reflect as often as possible. It's how I remember the good times. It's how I correct the bad. It's with reflection that others are be able to remember and take wisdom from me.

### How this article is written

I believe that there will be two types of people reading this bloggy-ish article in front of you.

The first is a professional. Maybe this professional wants to improve the processes at their job. They might recognize that there is a lot of time wasted on re-learning things over-and-over: each member of a team re-discovering something that everybody already know. Maybe they recognize that "tribal knowledge" is rampant, harming productivity for all members of the team. They might also hate writing grueling documentation, or simply not have the time to do so.

The second type of person is probably a friend of mine. They'll probably have the same interests as the professional, but would also like to hear a personal twist on this whole thing. They might be a gamer, a musician, or some hobbyist. I've come to realize that this 'record everything' thing encompasses pretty much anything you do involving a computer, and perhaps even more.

With those two types of people in mind (you know which one you are by now), I'm going to split this article into two sections: professional and personal. Each will provide background specific to what you might be more interested in. Depending on which type of person you are, you might hop right over to your section of interest.

### Personal

I recently had a conversation with a friend, Dylan, in which he asked (interrogated) me to reflect on my final semester at UCF. I didn't think much of it at first, I thought it would only be a short 15 minute conversation. 15 minutes turned into 30 minutes turned into an hour and 15 minutes. There was a lot to reflect on and I hadn't realized it until words started flowing from my mouth with an eager listener prodding into the folds of my brain. Fortunately, he had been taking notes on our conversation too. I came to some revelations<sup>1</sup> that I really wanted to revisit later on and those notes will be handy then. 

After our conversation, I remembered how often I had reflected on my past while helping students as a teaching assistant. Students often came to office hours to ask about non-class topics like "how do I prepare for an internship?" and "what classes actually matter in this program?". I had to consider what I had experienced in my time at UCF to give them decent advice as to what challenges they would face in the future. There was a lot of (subjectively) good info that only a couple of students got to hear. 

I had put a **ton** of thought into the reflections and advice that I discussed. It felt like a waste to have all that info stuck in the noggin's of a few people whose memories [decay over time][1]... With my advice given as a TA, I wouldn't be able to reach students later on. With the reflections I discussed with Dylan, the insights would fade and I would most of what I learned.

This whole "reflection" thing wasn't scalable at all and hey, I'm a computer scientist. A good computer scientist can identify something that isn't scalable, then work to change it.


### Professional

If you work in software, you know that documentation is an ever-present pain. Reading it results in seering pain, writing it results in third-degree burns, and when there is none... See the image below. How often do you find a complete lack of documentation?

One of my jobs was working with a customer-facing, high-performance service spanning a few teams. The team was relatively young when I joined it: many of the engineers were there when the product was launched.
