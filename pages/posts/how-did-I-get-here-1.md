Reflection is good. Reflection is how you gain self-confidence. Reflection is what I'm doing. It's what I want to remember. It's how I want others to be able to remember and take wisdom from me.

I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine in which he ~~interrogated me~~ asked me to reflect on my final semester at UCF. I didn't think much of it at first, I thought it would only be a short 15 minute conversation. 15 minutes turned into 30 minutes turned into an hour and 15 minutes. There was a lot to reflect on and I hadn't realized it until words started flowing from my mouth with an eager listener prodding into the folds of my brain. Fortunately, he had been taking notes on our conversation too. I came to some revelations<sup>1</sup> that I really wanted to revisit later on and those notes will be handy then. 

After our conversation, I remembered how often I had reflected on my past while helping students as a teaching assistant. Students often came to office hours to ask about non-class topics like "how do I prepare for an internship?" and "what classes actually matter in this program?". I had to consider what I had experienced in my time at UCF to give them decent advice as to what challenges they would face in the future. There was a lot of (subjectively) good information that only a couple of students got to hear. I had a **ton** of thought put into the advice that I gave and it felt like a bit of a waste to have all that information stuck in the memory of a few people who's memories may [decay over time][1]... I wouldn't be able to reach students in a similar position to those students later on either. 

This whole "reflection" thing wasn't scalable at all and hey, I'm a computer scientist. A good computer scientist can identify something that isn't scalable, then work to change it.
