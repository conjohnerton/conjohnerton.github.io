Okay‚Ä¶ This last part of the title might be a bit of a stretch, since my journey _actually_ took me a little over a year. Perhaps one day, we might cure aging and one year will become a meager drop in the plentiful bucket of fruitful, healthy years. Worry not though, I firmly believe that you can get an internship and in a manageable amount of time.

This article will walk you through how I approached my first and final year of internship searching, where I messed up, and what steps led me to prevail over my goals. I made a lot of erroneous decisions and wasted a ton of time.

My goal here is to let you know what **didn‚Äôt **work for me, then to show you what did. Maybe I‚Äôll help you save _some_ of your precious time and stress. Maybe you‚Äôll think my process is kind of ‚Äúcheat-ey‚Äù, but it worked for me and I know that it works for plenty of others too. But hey, the system is broken for allowing this kind of system, so I prefer to call it optimized. Even if I only save 1 day during your internship search, if 10 people read this, that‚Äôs 10 whole days saved in the world. As the number of readers grows, the number of days saved does too ‚Äî that‚Äôs O(n) growth.

#### Introduction

I‚Äôm going to make the assumption that you have are at least at an‚Ä¶ intermediate level of programming knowledge: that you have at least some general knowledge of the data structures and algorithms that you‚Äôll be using and know which programming language you‚Äôre going to use for the tech interviews.

> Use python for most things, it has so many wÃ∂oÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂fÃ∂uÃ∂l magical capabilities and you don‚Äôt have to **write** as much stuff if you‚Äôre white-boarding. Writing stuff? Yeah, I hate that too. Plus, all the other CS nerds tell me that it‚Äôs the best thing to use.

> I trust the nerds this time around.

> - Me, at this current moment

I went into my first interview season just after finishing up my third Computer Science course. I had never programmed, nor had I known anything about programming a year prior. For the intent of this article, I‚Äôll call that **an Extremely Short Amount of Time**; that‚Äôs the stretch I mentioned earlier. However, if you‚Äôve already gotten that ‚Äògeneral knowledge‚Äô I mentioned above then *congratulations, *you‚Äôve already made it 80% of the way through this thing! Pat yourself on the back and go do some stretches: we‚Äôve got some work to do.

#### Here‚Äôs what I did ‚Äî and why it failed

My initial approach to getting my internship included *sending out 300 applications while nearly delirious from a lack of sleep, dabbling in and getting frustrated with random Leetcode problems a couple of nights a week, *and _wondering if I belonged in this industry when I‚Äôd get rejection after rejection and not be able to solve any of the interview problems I was faced with._

![üòë pls respond fb, google, amazon‚Ä¶ pls give me a job üòë](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2156/1*UJ62sij1svicrgeI0K4NPw.jpeg)

To sum up the first part, I would shotgun out applications one after another late at night when I had no energy to do anything else. Pop onto YouTube, Netflix, or whatever streaming platform you use and try following [this tutorial from FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/here-are-4-best-ways-to-apply-for-software-engineer-jobs-and-exactly-how-to-use-them-a644a88b2241/).

This was probably the best part of my first approach. There‚Äôs honestly not much that you can offer as an intern so it‚Äôs nearly up to the luck of the draw. Luckily, a lot of the bigger companies are willing to at least give you the chance to interview, especially if you can get some conversation going one on one.

The second part is where I really messed up. I‚Äôd hop onto [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), a technical interview prep platform, randomly throughout my week and sort all the problems by acceptance rate. I kept telling myself, ‚ÄúI just need to keep going and get through most of the problems on the platform. Then I‚Äôll be ready.‚Äù I was astonishingly delusional. With such a lofty goal, I might as well have said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to run a marathon next week.‚Äù ‚Äî I don‚Äôt run like that. I will be explaining a much healthier, more manageable approach to preparing for technical questions in a bit.

The third part reflects more on my own morale during that period of time. It really, **really** sucks to get ghosted, instantly rejected, and seemingly led on by companies. After all, you‚Äôre trying to get some experience so that you can make a difference in the world. It‚Äôs soul crushing to have your ambitions stifled. Crush your soul more than a few times and you‚Äôve got a full blown crisis.

This is me letting you know that no matter how many times you get rejected, how many people, including your classmates and professors, make you feel like you don‚Äôt belong here, and how hard you have to grind to get something that some others just ‚Äúget‚Äù, that you still belong here. You belong here just as much as every other intelligent individual who finds an interest in click-clacking on a keyboard to make cool things happen.

> You belong here.

It was a rough couple of months. I didn‚Äôt, and still don‚Äôt enjoy doing Leetcode problems, for the most part. I felt like all hopes were down the drain until I heard an intriguing strategy from someone who had previous success at getting offers from Google and Facebook.

#### A Better Plan

Forget dabbling in random Leetcode problems. That‚Äôs a fool‚Äôs game.

Forget sorting by acceptance rate. That‚Äôs just asking to waste time on the easy problems that aren‚Äôt getting asked in interviews.

May I present to you: **A Targeted Study Plan!**

> **Note**: This technique will most **not** work for smaller companies, since they will be less likely to ask problems like these.

First of all, let‚Äôs say that you‚Äôve got an interview coming up. Nice job so far! I‚Äôm going to use Microsoft as an example, since they‚Äôre a pretty nice company. üòä This step gives you a couple of options going forward.

The first option involves purchasing Leetcode premium and using the company tags, sorted by frequency to find the most commonly asked questions for the upcoming interview. Alternatively, you can do what I did and simply search the Leetcode discussion boards for a helpful posts that contain the same collection of questions, usually sorted by frequency. The ‚Äúbuy Leetcode‚Äù option is a pretty self-explanatory process, so I‚Äôll go over the second option here.

So, head onto Leetcode and click on the [‚Äòdiscuss‚Äô ](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question?currentPage=1&orderBy=hot&query=)tab. Luckily enough, there is are some nice folks that have pinned an ever updating list of interview questions from some of the bigger companies. Since, in this example, I‚Äôm using Microsoft, go ahead and [click on the link for their question list](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/398023/Microsoft-Online-Assessment-Questions).

![The good stuff](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4960/1*yqn85oqRZLMupkhOVO-rtQ.png)

Now that you‚Äôre there, you now have access to all the questions that were recently asked by Microsoft. Chances are, they will pop up in your interviews too! Work through them one by one and learn them well. By well, I mean make it a goal to be able to **at least** solve 90% of the questions with sub-optimal solutions.

![This is **almost **the approach we‚Äôre taking here.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*T5PKbvEKDPxjZOh4yCFHRQ.png)

_But wait, there‚Äôs more!_

Instead of trying to work through the problems blindly, I recommend taking a bit of time to read through the problems, try to think up your own solution **without any code**, and then looking at the the real solution! (Or the discussion posts for each question, which may be a hit or miss experience)

After you‚Äôve gone through each of the questions and made a good attempt to understand **why **each solution works, grab a friend for some mock interviews and follow this process:

1. Have your friend pick a random question from the list.

1. Have your friend comb through some of the solutions so that they can be familiar with them and can help guide you just like an interviewer would do in a real interview.

1. Do the mock interview on a live-video chat in a google doc or in person on a whiteboard/piece of paper. To conduct a good mock interview, [check out this example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz9tKlF431k) to get a feel for how a good interview will go.

1. Repeat steps 1‚Äì3 a few times in the few weeks leading up to your interview.

#### Now You‚Äôre Ready

I firmly believe that if you follow this process and continue to work on solving randomly picked problems independently, you‚Äôll find that your interview is a piece of cake. Chances are, you will be asked one of the problems from the list, in which case, you can work on talking your interview through your solution. If you receive a problem you haven‚Äôt yet encountered, you might have seen a similar problem previously and may be able to work your way through it.

You have every tool to your disposal and know how to use them optimally. So set up your plan, go have a good stretch, and get ready. You‚Äôve got a successful tech career ahead of you ‚Äî all you have to do is crush your interviews this Fall.
