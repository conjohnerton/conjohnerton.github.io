# Record Everything

Reflection is good. Reflection is how you can gain both self-confidence and self-awareness.

I try to reflect as often as possible. It's how I remember the good times. It's how I correct the bad. It's with reflection that others can remember and take wisdom from me.

If the pop articles I've recently read are correct, we're all cyborgs. We aren't the kind with weird cyber-punk implants (At least, not yet). We are the boring kind of cyborg: our cybernetic extensions are our phones and computers. Stop relying on that mushy human brain you have, and start augmenting your memory with computing power. (And try to remain in control of all that data yourself) Hark! We're in the age of information! Take advantage of your newfound tools and spread your knowledge scalably.

### The structure of this article

I believe that there will be two types of people reading this bloggy-ish article in front of you.

The first is a professional. Maybe this professional wants to improve the processes at their job. They might recognize that there is a lot of time wasted on re-learning things over and over: each member of a team re-discovering something that everybody already knows. Maybe they recognize that "tribal knowledge" is rampant, harming productivity for all team members. They might hate writing grueling documentation or not have the time to write it.

The second type of person is probably a friend of mine. They'll probably have the same interests as the professional but would also like to hear a personal twist on this whole thing. They might be a gamer, a musician, or some hobbyist. I've come to realize that this 'record everything' thing encompasses pretty much anything you do involving a computer, and perhaps even more.

With those two types of people in mind (you know which one you are by now), I'm going to split this article into two sections: professional and personal. Each will provide background specific to your interest. Depending on which type of person you are, you might hop right over to your section of interest.

### Personal

I recently had a conversation with a friend, Dylan, in which he asked (interrogated) me to reflect on my final semester at UCF. I thought it would only be a short 15-minute conversation. Fifteen minutes turned into thirty. Thirty turned into an hour and fifteen minutes. We talked each other's ears off. I hadn't realized it until words started flowing from my mouth with an eager listener prodding into the folds of my brain. Fortunately, he had been taking notes on our conversation too. Those notes would come in handy later on: there were some great insights in that conversation.

After our conversation, I remembered how often I had reflected on my past while helping students as a teaching assistant. Students often came to office hours to ask about non-class topics like "how do I prepare for an internship?" and "what classes matter in this program?". I'd considered my experiences at UCF to give them decent advice as to what challenges they would face in the future. There was a lot of (subjectively) good info that only a couple of students got to hear.

I had put a **ton** of thought into the reflections and advice that I discussed. It felt like a waste to have all that info stuck in the noggins of a few people whose memories [decay over time][1]... With my advice given as a TA, I wouldn't be able to reach students later on. With the reflections I discussed with Dylan, the insights would fade. I would forget nearly all of what I learned.

This whole "reflection" and "knowledge" thing wasn't scalable at all. I'm a computer scientist, after all. A good computer scientist can identify something that isn't scalable, then work to change it.

This next point is a bit more somber. As humans, we are **all** destined to return to the ether, whence we started. Nobody knows their fate, nor the fate of those around them. As someone dear fades into memories, how will you remember their appearance? Will you always recall their jokes and mannerisms correctly? Will you remember their voice? This advice urges you to store as many of your memories as possible. You will forget fewer of those things. This section reminds me of this melancholy musical project called [The Caretaker][2]. It's a terrifying experience to get lost in The Caretaker's crinkled shards of decaying tunes, yet remains a gripping musical representation of memory decay.

### Professional

If you work in software, you know that documentation is an ever-present pain. Reading it results in searing pain, writing it results in third-degree burns, and when there is none... See the image below for what to imagine. How often do you find a complete lack of documentation?

One of my jobs was working with a customer-facing, high-performance service spanning a few teams. The team I was on was relatively young when I joined: many of the current engineers were there during the product launch. Due to the team's age, there never came a time when the tribal knowledge on the team would get put into documentation. Although, the team would have a weekly learning session that did cover some of that knowledge, usually on a higher level. However, these were sometimes canceled outright or not recorded for the team to view later on.

**Side note**: If you don't do a recurring knowledge session, I'd recommend trying it out. I think it helped the newbies get up to speed faster.

During that job, I had to help a couple of interns get up to speed with their jobs. Later on, help them with some of the questions they had about their intern projects. I met with the interns once a week and sometimes more if it was necessary. During some of those meetings, they might have asked me to explain some system that I had previously worked on. I gave the interns a deep dive when I could. Those explanations had already left the mouths of other team members numerous times, yet nobody had recorded them. What a waste of time!

All these discoveries didn't matter if someone else had to re-discover or even re-re-discover it all over again. This knowledge thing wasn't very scalable. As clever, considerate, productive humans, we probably care about making things better: more so when it's easy to do so.

### A solution to our problems

Just pull out your recording software and start **recording**!!!
